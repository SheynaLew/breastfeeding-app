# Components Needed

- Header / banner
- Titles
  - These are for the Start Date, End Date, and Congratulations
- Calenders
  - Consider using Ant Design for this
- Button
  - Submit
    - This will store the dates in each calender to two variables, calculate the number of months between the two dates, and trigger the first set of components to be hidden and the award to be displayed, along with the congratulations text and the name of the award.

* Award image
  - To be called by the API (will need to create a database to store the links to these images)
* Award description text (maybe a p tag?)
