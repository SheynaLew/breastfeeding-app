# Breastfeeding Awards App - FrontEnd

## Background

This is the front end of a breastfeeding awards generating app I have created to solidify my React skills and knowledge picked up as a Bootcamper at the School of Code.

## Aim

- MVP - To create an app that allows breastfeeding / chestfeeding parents to calculate and display the award they have achieved, determined by the length of their breastfeeding / chestfeeding journey.

- Future iterations
  - Show parents what the next award they can reach will be and how long before it can be achieved.
  - Random breastfeeding fact generator
  - Random breastfeeding meme generator
  - Forum for parents to talk about their journeys etc
  - Support from lactaction consultants

## Frontend role in app

- Display calendars for start and end of journey
- Button to submit dates and calculate length of journey, then bring awards from backend
- Display awards and text brought from backend

## Implementation

- React front end.
